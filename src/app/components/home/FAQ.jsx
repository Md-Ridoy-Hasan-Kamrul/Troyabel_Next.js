    question: "What's the difference between your coaching and a UX bootcamp?",
    answer:
      'Bootcamps offer a one-size-fits-all curriculum. My coaching is 100% personalized to you. We leverage your unique background, focus on your specific goals, and build a portfolio that is uniquely yours, not a copy of a class assignment. Additionally, we tap into a broad network of academic and design industry experts.',

    question: 'Do I need a design or tech background to succeed?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely not. Some of the best UX professionals come from diverse fields like psychology, teaching, marketing, and customer service. I specialize in helping you translate your existing experience into the language of UX.',
  },

    question: 'How long does the process take?',
    answer:
      'The Career Pivot Accelerator program typically takes 3-6 months, depending on your pace and starting point. The goal is not speed, but to build a durable, high-quality foundation for a long-term career.',

    question: 'Do you guarantee a job?',
    answer:
      'No one can ethically guarantee a job. However, I guarantee that I will provide you with the exact strategies, tools, and portfolio assets that have successfully launched careers at top companies. Your success is my success, and I am fully invested in your outcome.',
